# In Python There are no arrays,So alternatly there are Lists...!
# These Lists are Implemeted as Array's...!

# Syntax Of Python_Lists (Array) ðŸ‘‡ !
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# To Access Valus from Python_lists (Array) ðŸ‘‡ !

print("\nThe 1st value in Python_List => ", numbers[0]) # Prints 1st Value..!
print("The 2nd value in Python_List => ", numbers[1]) # Prints 2nd Value..! 
print("The 3rd value in Python_List => ", numbers[2]) # Prints 3rd Value..! 
print("The 4th value in Python_List => ", numbers[3]) # Prints 4th Value..!
print("The 5th value in Python_List => ", numbers[4]) # Prints 5th Value..!

# To Acess all Values from Python_Lists (Array) ðŸ‘‡ !

print("\nThe values of Python_Lists are => ", numbers) # Prints all the Value..!

# To update the Values in Python_Lists ðŸ‘‡ !

numbers[0] = 100 # First Postion value will change..! 
numbers[1] = 200 # Second Postion Value will change..!
numbers[2] = 300 # Third Position Value will Change..!
numbers[3] = 400 # Fourth Position value will change..! 
numbers[4] = 500 # Fifth Position value will change..! 

print("\nThe Changed Value of Python_List [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] => ", numbers)

# In Python_Lists different Data_types can be stored in the list ( " Heterogenous - mixture ") ðŸ‘‡ !
